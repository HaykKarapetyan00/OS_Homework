The program creates a shared memory region and initializes semaphores for synchronizing access to the shared memory between two processes, a producer process and a consumer process. The producer process generates 100 integers and adds them to the shared buffer while the consumer process retrieves and prints them. The semaphores "empty", "full" and "mutex" are used to ensure that the producer only adds to the buffer when there is space, the consumer only retrieves items from the buffer when there are items, and the buffer is protected from simultaneous access by multiple processes. Once the two processes have finished, the program deallocates the shared memory region and the semaphores.
